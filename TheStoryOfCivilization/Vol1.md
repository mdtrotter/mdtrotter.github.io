# Notes  
## Chapter 1  
- Durant posits that there are conditions essential to elevating from "barbarism" to civilization: \[physical\] geological, geographical, economy, culture, \[psychological\] political order, common language, unifying moral code, education, common beliefs
- "For civilization is not something inborn or imperishable; it must be acquired anew by every generation, and any serious interruption in its financing or its transmission may bring it to an end. Man differs from the beast only by education, which may be defined as the technique of transmitting civilization."

## Chapter 2
### Section 1
- The first step man took toward civilization was transitioning from hunting and gathering to farming and animal domestication.
- "...the squirrel that gathered nuts for a later feast, the bees that filled the comb with honey, the ants that laid up stores for a rainy day— these were among the first creators of civilization. It was they... who taught our ancestors the art of providing for tomorrow"

### Section 2
- The path to developing economy began with the discovery of fire. Beyond this, again, man is inspired by nature to develop tools. This then led to trade between people based on the resources native to those peoples. When metals could eventually be mined and shaped, value began to be measured in these metals as opposed to trading of goods. Interestingly metal coins has been the generally accepted form of currency until relatively recently.
- "[Man] imitated the tools and industry of the animal: he saw the monkey flinging rocks and fruit upon his enemies, or breaking open nuts and oysters with a stone; he saw the beaver building a dam, the birds making nests and bowers, the chimpanzees raising something very like a hut."

### Section 3
- In this section, Durant explores the natural evolution from the communist economy of hunters and gatherers, who had no notion of ownership and property, to an economy ownership, trade, social classes, and slavery. Though this transition to ownership and property perhaps emerged several thousand years ago, the foundations for economies today are little different. Only recently has slavery become obsolete through enlightened moral understanding, however we can find many modern examples of the socially and economically strong taking advantage of and benifitting from the labor of the weaker.
- "Gradually, through agriculture and slavery, through the division of labor and the inherent diversity of men, the comparative equality of natural society was replaced by inequality and class divisions. “In the primitive group we find as a rule no distinction between slave and free, no serfdom, no caste, and little if any distinction between chief and followers .” Slowly the increasing complexity of tools and trades subjected the unskilled or weak to the skilled or strong; every invention was a new weapon in the hands of the strong, and further strengthened them in their mastery and use of the weak."

## Chapter 3
### Section 1
- Durant begins this chapter by demonstrating how individuals dislike government, but acquiesce to it because they also desire social interaction and the safety that a governed community provides. The natural violent interactions between clans and peoples spurned the centralization of authority.
- "It is war that makes the chief, the king and the state, just as it is these that make war... primitive life was incarnadined with intermittent war... Property was the mother, war was the father, of the state."

### Section 2
- This section covers the necessity of the state and the tools used to "indoctrinate" the governed to the machinations of the state. The state formed as a response to aggression from hunter groups to raid farms for food. Although humans are naturally disinclined to be restricted or "dominated" by the state, this was preferable as it helped develop the social relationships, through trade regulations and laws, that helped to maintain internal peace.
- "Hence the state, in order to maintain itself, used and forged many instruments of indoctrination— the family, the church, the school— to build in the soul of the citizen a habit of patriotic loyalty and pride."
