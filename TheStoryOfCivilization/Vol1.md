# Notes  
## Chapter 1  
- Durant posits that there are conditions essential to elevating from "barbarism" to civilization: \[physical\] geological, geographical, economy, culture, \[psychological\] political order, common language, unifying moral code, education, common beliefs
- "For civilization is not something inborn or imper- ishable; it must be acquired anew by every generation, and any serious interruption in its financing or its transmission may bring it to an end. Man differs from the beast only by education, which may be defined as the technique of transmitting civilization."
