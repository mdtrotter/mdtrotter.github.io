# Notes  
## Chapter 1  
- Durant posits that there are conditions essential to elevating from "barbarism" to civilization: \[physical\] geological, geographical, economy, culture, \[psychological\] political order, common language, unifying moral code, education, common beliefs
- "For civilization is not something inborn or imper- ishable; it must be acquired anew by every generation, and any serious interruption in its financing or its transmission may bring it to an end. Man differs from the beast only by education, which may be defined as the technique of transmitting civilization."

## Chapter 2
### Section 1
- The first step man took toward civilization was transitioning from hunting and gathering to farming and animal domestication.
- "...the squirrel that gathered nuts for a later feast, the bees that filled the comb with honey, the ants that laid up stores for a rainy day— these were among the first creators of civilization. It was they... who taught our ancestors the art of providing for tomorrow"

### Section 2
- The path to developing economy began with the discovery of fire. Beyond this, again, man is inspired by nature to develop tools. This then led to trade between people based on the resources native to those peoples. When metals could eventually be mined and shaped, value began to be measured in these metals as opposed to trading of goods. Interestingly metal coins has been the generally accepted form of currency until relatively recently.
- "[Man] imitated the tools and industry of the animal: he saw the monkey flinging rocks and fruit upon his enemies, or breaking open nuts and oysters with a stone; he saw the beaver building a dam, the birds making nests and bowers, the chimpanzees raising something very like a hut."

### Section 3
- In this chapter, Durant explores the natural evolution from the communist economy of hunters and gatherers, who had no notion of ownership and property, to an economy ownership, trade, social classes, and slavery. Though this transition to ownership and property perhaps emerged several thousand years ago, the foundations for economies today are little different. Only recently has slavery become obsolete through enlightened moral understanding, however we can find many modern examples of the socially and economically strong taking advantage of and benifitting from the labor of the weaker.
- "Gradually, through agriculture and slavery, through the division of labor and the inherent diversity of men, the comparative equality of natural society was replaced by inequality and class divisions. “In the primitive group we find as a rule no distinction between slave and free, no serfdom, no caste, and little if any distinction between chief and followers .” Slowly the increasing complexity of tools and trades subjected the unskilled or weak to the skilled or strong; every invention was a new weapon in the hands of the strong, and further strengthened them in their mastery and use of the weak."
